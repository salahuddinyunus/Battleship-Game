Python Battleship Game
User Guide

- This game mainly relies on luck.
- You must shoot down the enemy ship before running out of shots/tries. If you run out, you lose.
- At the beginning, you are given the choice to ask for help and if you want to play or not.
- If you ask for help, the program will read out some tidbits of information which I will inform you of.
- If you say no, the program closes and bids you good day.
- If you say yes, the program asks you for which difficulty setting you wish to play on.
- Easy mode gives you a 6x6 arena and 10 shots.
- Normal Mode gives you a 7x7 arena and 12 shots.
- Hard Mode gives you an 8x8 arena and 14 shots.
- Once you pick a difficulty, you are thrust into the game.
- The arena will pop up and you will be given the option to shoot.
- First of all, to be able to shoot, you must first enter the corresponding letter along the top row, and then follow it by the
  corresponding number along the leftmost column (example - a5, B3, g2, etc.).
- Afterwards, you will be told whether your shot hit or missed.
- If it missed, you will lose a shot and that area that you shot will be marked with an "O".
- If it hit, you will NOT lose a shot and that area will be marked with an "X".
- The ship can be anywhere from 2 to 4 tiles long.
- The ship can also either be facing vertically or horizontally.
- If you miss too many times and run out of shots, you will lose. You will have the opportunity to play again if you wish
  and maybe it would be a good idea to pick an easier difficulty, or attempt the same one again, up to you.
- If you end up sinking the ship by hitting all of the ship's tiles, you will win! Your commanding officer will applaud you
  and you will be given the option to play again if you wish.
- That's about it, good luck on the battlefield out there soldier!
